Fire Tools is a powerful collection of tools that helps debloat and install Google services on your Fire Tablet to make it feel snappier and improve usability. Additionally, it supports custom launchers such as Nova, Lawnchair, or anyÂ `.apk(m)`. If you need to install multiple apps quickly, there's a batch installer. It's as easy as dropping all your `.apk(m)`s in the Batch folder and clicking the Batch Install button! No root required!

* Although this project has similar goals, it is not affiliated with Datastream33's Amazon Fire Toolbox
* Some features of the Fire Tools may break due to Fire OS updates but I'll try my best to keep them working.
* Set timezone settings before debloat! (re-enable `com.amazon.kindle.otter.oobe` to change date & time settings)
* Google Apps are downloaded from [ApkMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) and are included in releases for convienence see [terms](https://github.com/mrhaydendp/Fire-Tools/blob/main/Fire-Tools/Gapps/README.md). APK names and corresponding URLs can be found in Fire-Tools/Gapps/README.md
* Debloat will disable most amazon apps with the exception of: `Calculator`, `Camera`, `Clock`, `Files`, `Fire Launcher`, `Silk Browser`, and `Settings`
